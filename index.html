    <area title=" Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisine native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available such as: chocolates, herbs, vegetables and fruits. The dishes are then served according to taste in either mild, medium or hot. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices, like Hinduism and traditions. Some Indian dishes are common in more than one region of India, with many vegetarian and vegan dishes. Some ingredients commonly found in Indian dishes include, chicken, rice, ginger and spices." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="639,280,741,329"  alt="India">
    <area title= "Well-known traditional British dishes include full breakfast, fish and chips, the Christmas dinner,[3] the Sunday roast, steak and kidney pie, shepherd's pie, and bangers and mash. People in Britain, however, eat a wide variety of foods based on the cuisines of Europe, India, and other parts of the world. British cuisine has many regional varieties within the broader categories of English, Scottish and Welsh cuisine and Northern Irish cuisine. Each has developed its own regional or local dishes, many of which are geographically indicated foods such as Cornish pasties, the Yorkshire pudding, Cumberland Sausage, Arbroath Smokie, and Welsh cakes." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="414,150,442,196" target="_parent" alt="UK">
    <area title="Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[9] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[10] Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="515,256,455,220" target="_parent" alt="Italy">
    <area title="American cuisine reflects the history of the United States, blending the culinary contributions of various groups of people from around the world, including indigenous American Indians, African Americans, Asians, Europeans, Pacific Islanders, and Latin Americans. Though much of American cuisine is fusion cuisine reflecting global cuisine, many regional cuisines have deeply rooted ethnic heritages, including Cajun, Louisiana Creole, Native American, New Mexican, Pennsylvania Dutch, Soul food, and Tlingit. Early Native Americans utilized a number of cooking methods in early American cuisine that have been blended with early European cooking methods to form the basis of what is now American cuisine. " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="267,174,41,290" target="_parent" alt="USA">
    <area title="French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the Channel and of course inland. In the 14th century, Guillaume Tirel, a court chef known as Taillevent, wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France. In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="438,217,492,137" target="_parent" alt="France">
    <area title="Australian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bushfood.[2] Australia has become famous for the high quality of its exports, with major agricultural industries including cattle and calves, wheat, fruit and nuts, vegetables, milk, sheep and lambs (for meat and wool), poultry, barley, canola.[3] The country is also well regarded for its locally-made wine, beer and soft drinks." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="945,598,780,474" target="_parent" alt="australia">
    <area title="Swedish cuisine is the traditional food of the people of Sweden. Due to Sweden's large north-to-south expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.[1]" href="" shape="rect" coords="522,178,485,118" target="_parent" alt="Sweden">
    <area title="Spanish cuisine is heavily influenced by historical processes that shaped local culture and society in some of Europe's Iberian Peninsula territories. Geography and climate has had great influence on cooking methods and available ingredients. These cooking methods and ingredients are still present in the gastronomy of the various regions that make up Spain. Spanish cuisine derives from a complex history where invasions and conquests of Spain have modified traditions which made new ingredients available. Thus, the current and old cuisine of Spain incorporates old and new traditions." href="" shape="rect" coords="451,257,413,211" target="_parent" alt="Spain">
    <area title="The traditional cuisine of Japan, washoku (和食), lit. Japanese eating (or kappō (ja:割烹)), is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, staples include noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in sukiyaki and nikujaga." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cuisine" shape="rect" coords="880,279,837,186" target="_parent" alt="Japan">
    <area title="Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide." href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine shape="0" coords="635,178,815,278,377,129,467,146,796,185" target="_parent" alt="China">
